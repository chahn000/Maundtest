Maundtest
=========

This is my first effort at creating an application using node.js, express, jade, and mongodb (using monk as an interface to mongodb). A big thank you to the website cwbuecheler.com for providing the tutorial that is the foundation of the work I have created. Mongodb was installed locally for this application.
